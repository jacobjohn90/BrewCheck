# BrewCheck

##About BrewCheck
This App was made for all beer lovers. As some may know, Atlanta, Ga has new breweries popping up left and right. With so many breweries, its hard to keep track of which breweries you've been to or which you would like to go to. Further more, wouldn't it be amazing to have an app where you can remember which beers you had at that particular brewery so you can try new beers later? That's where BrewCheck comes in handy. This app is a little checklist to allow users to put in breweries they've been too or breweries they heard about. They can also add beers these specific breweries offer and rate them so others can see if they're good or not. This is my first full-stack app, with more features to come in the future!
